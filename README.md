Practicing is also streamlined, as the extension implements a spaced repetition algorithm based on the Anki system. Any cards due for studying will automatically appear for practicing once the extension popup is opened. Feedback to the cards (Fail, Hard, Good, Easy) will determine when the card is scheduled for later review.
